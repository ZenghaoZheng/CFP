# CFP
Accelerating High-Performance 3D Human Pose  Estimation via Cascaded Fourier Pruning and Line  Pose
# Contribution
This project is used for accelerating 3D human pose estimation. We propose a CFP to reduce redundant computation for pose sequence. We inject our method to several mainstream backbone suchas MotionBERT, MotionAGFormer, MixSTE, MHformer and so on. Our method achieve a win-win in speed and MPJPE. For example, when applying to MixSTE, Ours method achieve 40.5mm by reducing nearly 50% computation.
